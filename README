This is a stepper driver motor for linux kernel developed to be used
on a board with available gpios.

More info on use and ioctl interface see tthe code or:
	http://www.mignanti.eu/progetti/embd/daisy2

VERSION HISTORY
---------------
tag v0.4:
 * Reorganize the no-pwm version. Now it using a struct to mangle the data.
 * Update the ioctl to support syscall redefinition for v2.6.38+
 * Add limit support
 * The pwm version is not aligned anymore to the nopwm version (that will be
	the default until pwm api didn't goes upstream)

tag v0.3:
 * Added a version of the driver (stepper-nopwm.c) that emulate the funcition
	of Bill Gatliff's api.
 * On this tag you can found both version compatible with linux kernel v2.6.38
 * Reorder the ioctl value (see motor.h) this values can be consider realiable

tag v0.1:
 * This version of kstepper is featuring a stepper driver build on Bill Gatfill
	pwm api (http://lwn.net/Articles/303978/), this was implement for linux v2.6.35

CROSS-COMPILE
-------------
To cross-compile this driver you need a gcc-arm and configured kernel. Then
simple type:

make KERNELDIR=<path_to_kernel> CROSSCOMPILE=<path to ggc cross compiler>

This will generate stepper-nopwm.ko and stepper-drv.ko
